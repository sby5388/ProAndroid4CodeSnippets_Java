For each chapter that includes a sample project and/or a number of code snippets
provided as "Listings", you'll find the corresponding source code within these
archives for your copy/pasting pleasure. 

The fully worked samples (Compass, Earthquake, EmergencyResponder, GForceMeter,
Weather Station, Where Am I, Hello World, and Star Sign Picker) are named as
appropriate, suffixed with the corresponding chapter number (and where necessary 
the revision number within the chapter), representing each stage in the project.



You can import these projects directly into Android Studio, then compile 
and run them.



The source code from every code listing is available in the "snippets" archives,
with the chapter number suffix (Eg. Snippets_ch2). Please note that these 
listings have been provided within Android Studio projects to provide a 
simple way for you to cut and paste useful code snippets, and 
to provide
some additional context around how several of these 
independent snippets may 
work together, but they are not intended to 
represent complete examples.



In both cases, it's inevitable that the version of the dependencies used within
these projects -- such as the support library, Android Architecture Components, 
Google Play services, Gradle, and the Android SDK -- will need to be updated
to match the latest versions available. We recommend always targeting the latest
version of the Android SDK, and using the latest versions of external libraries.


We hope you have fun with the sample projects and that you find them and the 

code snippets useful in creating your own Android applications!
